#DebugView



Debug View is a simple implementation of method swizzling to add red borders over each view for Debugging.

## Installation  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Cocoapods

    pod 'DebugView', '~> 0.0'

### From Source

Download the project and copy the file in "Source" directory into your project

## Usage (•ิ_•ิ)?

**Nothing to do here**, things will work automatically. YAY **＼（＾ ＾）／**

When you want to stop debugging, write the following in your prefix.pch

    #define NO_DEBUG_VIEW
      
##Examples

##Or you could try code injection 
**PS : Updated my iPhone to iOS 8, so you will have to wait for updated screenshots**
